## Hey 👋, This is Najwan Taha 

Hi! I'm Najwan. As a data-driven professional with a strong background in Business Intelligence and Data Analysis, I specialize in transforming complex data into actionable insights that drive strategic business decisions. With expertise in SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and data analysis, I am adept at leveraging these tools to extract, analyze, and visualize data to support business performance optimization.

My academic foundation includes a Master’s degree in Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering, where I honed my analytical and problem-solving abilities, and recently, I completed a Business Intelligence Analysis program at Tripleten Coding Bootcamp, equipping me with cutting-edge skills in data analytics and business intelligence tools.

Throughout my career, I’ve gained hands-on experience in both technical and cross-functional roles, including as a Scheduling Engineer at Schindler Group. There, I developed project schedules, performed detailed data analysis, and worked with teams to optimize resource allocation—skills I am eager to apply to data analysis and BI-focused roles. My experience in project management further refined my ability to manage complex tasks while maintaining focus on delivering data-driven solutions that improve outcomes.

I’m now seeking a Data Analyst or Business Intelligence Analyst position where I can leverage my strong technical expertise, analytical skills, and problem-solving mindset to contribute to data-driven decision-making and business growth.</p><p align='left'>
